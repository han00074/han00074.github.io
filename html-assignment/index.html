                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>My name is Jialin Han. I am a level 1 interactive media design student. I come from China, but I
                    have been in Canada for almost 9 years. Currently I live in Ottawa. I graduated from Moncton
                    flight college with a diploma in aviation technology in April <sup>25th</sup> 2015. After that I worked as a flight
                    instructor in a flight training school, then worked as a pilot for general aviation company for 6
                    years. </p>
                <p>During the <q>COVID-19</q> pandemic I saw that all the people in world had a hard time for
                    almost 2 years. Those years let me knew one thing - <strong>I should not put all my eggs in one basket.</strong>
                    There are so many unpredictable things in life. That is why I quit my job and enrolled in the
                    Algonquin College <abbr title=" Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program.</p>
                <p><em>As a mature student I already know that going back to school is not that easy, especially when I do not have any relevant experience. But the subject
                    is something that I like, so I feel it is worth working hard for.</em></p>
